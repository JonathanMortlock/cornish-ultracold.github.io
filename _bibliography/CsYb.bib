  abstract = {We probe the collective dynamics of a quantum degenerate Bose-Bose mixture of 133Cs and 174Yb with attractive interspecies interactions. Specifically, we excite vertical center-of-mass oscillations of the Cs condensate. We observe significant damping for the Cs dipole mode, due to the rapid transfer of energy to the larger Yb component and the ensuing acoustic dissipation. Numerical simulations based on coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations provide excellent agreement with experiment and additionally reveal the possibility of late-time revivals (beating), which are found to be highly sensitive to the Cs and Yb atom number combinations. By further tuning the interaction strength of Cs using a broad Feshbach resonance, we explore the stability of the degenerate mixture. We observe collapse of the Cs condensate mediated by the attractive Cs-Yb interaction when aCs{$<$}50a0, well above the single-species collapse threshold, in good agreement with simulations.},

  abstract = {We report the production of quantum degenerate Bose-Bose mixtures of Cs and Yb with both attractive (Cs+174Yb) and repulsive (Cs+170Yb) interspecies interactions. Dual-species evaporation is performed in a bichromatic optical dipole trap that combines light at 1070 nm and 532 nm to enable control of the relative trap depths for Cs and Yb. Maintaining a trap which is shallower for Yb throughout the evaporation leads to highly efficient sympathetic cooling of Cs for both isotopic combinations at magnetic fields close to the Efimov minimum in the Cs three-body recombination rate at around 22 G. For Cs+174Yb, we produce quantum mixtures with typical atom numbers of NYb∼5×104 and NCs∼5×103. We find that the attractive interspecies interaction (characterized by the scattering length aCsYb=−75a0) is stabilized by the repulsive intraspecies interactions. For Cs+170Yb, we produce quantum mixtures with typical atom numbers of NYb∼4×104 and NCs∼1×104. Here, the repulsive interspecies interaction (aCsYb=96a0) can overwhelm the intraspecies interactions, such that the mixture sits in a region of partial miscibility.},
