  abstract = {We present a simple motorised rotation mount for a half-wave plate that can be used to rapidly change the polarization of light. We use the device to switch a high power laser beam between different optical dipole traps in an ultracold atom experiment. The device uses a stepper motor with a hollow shaft, which allows a beam to propagate along the axis of the motor shaft, minimising inertia and mechanical complexity. A simple machined adapter is used to mount the wave plate. We characterise the performance of the device, focusing on its capability to switch a beam between the output ports of a polarizing beamsplitter cube. We demonstrate a switching time of 15.9(3) ms, limited by the torque of the motor. The mount has a reaction time of 0.52(3) ms, and a rotational resolution of 0.45 degrees. The rotation is highly reproducible, with the stepper motor not missing a step in 2000 repeated tests over 11 hours.},

  abstract = {We perform a measurement of the tune-out wavelength, λ0, between the D1, 62S1/2→62P1/2, and D2, 62S1/2→62P3/2, transitions for 133Cs in the ground hyperfine state (F=3,mF=+3). At λ0, the frequency-dependent scalar polarizability is zero leading to a zero scalar ac Stark shift. We measure the polarizability as a function of wavelength using Kapitza-Dirac scattering of a 133Cs Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional optical lattice, and determine the tune-out wavelength to be λ0=880.21790(40)stat(8)sys nm. From this measurement we determine the ratio of reduced matrix elements to be ∣∣⟨6P3/2∥d∥6S1/2⟩∣∣2/∣∣⟨6P1/2∥d∥6S1/2⟩∣∣2=1.9808(2). This represents an improvement of a factor of 10 over previous results derived from excited-state lifetime measurements. We use the present measurement as a benchmark test of high-precision theory.},
