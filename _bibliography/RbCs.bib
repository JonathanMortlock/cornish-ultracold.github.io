  abstract = {We explore coherent multi-photon processes in 87Rb133Cs molecules using 3-level lambda and ladder configurations of rotational and hyperfine states, and discuss their relevance to future applications in quantum computation and quantum simulation. In the lambda configuration, we demonstrate the driving of population between two hyperfine levels of the rotational ground state via a two-photon Raman transition. Such pairs of states may be used in the future as a quantum memory, and we measure a Ramsey coherence time for a superposition of these states of 58(9) ms. In the ladder configuration, we show that we can generate and coherently populate microwave dressed states via the observation of an Autler–Townes doublet. We demonstrate that we can control the strength of this dressing by varying the intensity of the microwave coupling field. Finally, we perform spectroscopy of the rotational states of 87Rb133Cs up to N = 6, highlighting the potential of ultracold molecules for quantum simulation in synthetic dimensions. By fitting the measured transition frequencies we determine a new value of the centrifugal distortion coefficient Dv = h × 207.3(2) Hz.},

Near this wavelength we observe unexpected two-photon transitions that may cause trap loss. We measure the ac Stark effect in external magnetic and electric fields, using microwave spectroscopy of the first rotational transition. We quantify the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the molecular polarizability at this wavelength. We demonstrate that a modest electric field can decouple the nuclear spins from the rotational angular momentum, greatly simplifying the ac Stark effect. We use this simplification to control the ac Stark shift using the polarization angle of the trapping laser.},

Here, we report the development of coherent quantum state control using microwave fields in 40 Ca 19 F and 87 Rb 133 Cs molecules, a crucial ingredient for many quantum simulation applications. We perform Ramsey interferometry measurements with fringe spacings of ∼1 kHz and investigate the dephasing time of a superposition of N = 0 and N = 1 rotational states when the molecules are confined. For both molecules, we show that a judicious choice of molecular hyperfine states minimises the impact of spatially varying transition-frequency shifts across the trap. For magnetically trapped 40 Ca 19 F we use a magnetically insensitive transition and observe a coherence time of 0.61(3) ms. For optically trapped 87 Rb 133 Cs we exploit an avoided crossing in the AC Stark shifts and observe a maximum coherence time of 0.75(6) ms.},

This coupling may be tuned by rotating the polarization of the linearly polarized trapping light. A combination of spectroscopic and parametric heating measurements allows complete characterization of the molecular polarizability at a wavelength of 1550 nm in both the ground and first excited rotational states.},

We partially suppress this loss mechanism by applying square-wave modulation to the trap intensity, such that the molecules spend 75\% of each modulation cycle in the dark. By varying the modulation frequency, we show that the lifetime of the collision complex is 0.53±0.06 ms in the dark. We find that the rate of optical excitation of the collision complex is 3-2+4×103 W-1 cm2 s-1 for λ=1550 nm, leading to a lifetime of {$<$}100 ns for typical trap intensities. These results explain the two-body loss observed in experiments on nonreactive bialkali molecules.},

  abstract = {Understanding ultracold collisions involving molecules is of fundamental importance for current experiments, where inelastic collisions typically limit the lifetime of molecular ensembles in optical traps. Here we present a broad study of optically trapped ultracold RbCs molecules in collisions with one another, in reactive collisions with Rb atoms, and in nonreactive collisions with Cs atoms. For experiments with RbCs alone, we show that by modulating the intensity of the optical trap, such that the molecules spend 75\% of each modulation cycle in the dark, we partially suppress collisional loss of the molecules. This is evidence for optical excitation of molecule pairs mediated via sticky collisions. We find that the suppression is less effective for molecules not prepared in the spin-stretched hyperfine ground state. This may be due either to longer lifetimes for complexes in the dark or to laser-free decay pathways. For atom–molecule mixtures, RbCs + Rb and RbCs + Cs, we demonstrate that the rate of collisional loss of molecules scales linearly with the density of atoms. This indicates that, in both cases, the loss of molecules is rate-limited by two-body atom–molecule processes. For both mixtures, we measure loss rates that are below the thermally averaged universal limit.},

  abstract = {Quantum states with long-lived coherence are essential for quantum computation, simulation and metrology. The nuclear spin states of ultracold molecules prepared in the singlet rovibrational ground state are an excellent candidate for encoding and storing quantum information. However, it is important to understand all sources of decoherence for these qubits, and then eliminate them, to reach the longest possible coherence times. Here we fully characterize the dominant mechanisms of decoherence for a storage qubit in an optically trapped ultracold gas of RbCs molecules using high-resolution Ramsey spectroscopy. Guided by a detailed understanding of the hyperfine structure of the molecule, we tune the magnetic field to where a pair of hyperfine states have the same magnetic moment. These states form a qubit, which is insensitive to variations in magnetic field. Our experiments reveal a subtle differential tensor light shift between the states, caused by weak mixing of rotational states. We demonstrate how this light shift can be eliminated by setting the angle between the linearly polarized trap light and the applied magnetic field to a magic angle of \$\$\textbackslash arccos (1/\textbackslash sqrt\{3\})\textbackslash approx 5\{5\}\^\{\textbackslash circ \}\$\$. This leads to a coherence time exceeding 5.6\,s at the 95\% confidence level.},

The frequency of each of these lasers is referenced to the cavity and is continuously tunable away from the cavity modes through the use of non-resonant electro-optic modulators. Self-heterodyne measurements suggest the laser linewidths are reduced to several 100 Hz. In the context of \textsuperscript{87}Rb\textsuperscript{133}Cs molecules produced via magnetoassociation on a Feshbach resonance, we demonstrate the performance of the laser system through one- and two-photon molecular spectroscopy.
