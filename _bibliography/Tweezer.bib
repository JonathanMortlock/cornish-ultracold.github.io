  abstract = {We prepare pairs of \$\^\{133\}\$Cs atoms in a single optical tweezer and perform Feshbach spectroscopy for collisions of atoms in the states \$(f=3, m\_f=\textbackslash pm3)\$. We detect enhancements in pair loss using a detection scheme where the optical tweezers are repeatedly subdivided. For atoms in the state \$(3,-3)\$, we identify resonant features by performing inelastic loss spectroscopy. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations and show that at typical experimental temperatures the loss features are mostly centred on zeroes in the scattering length, rather than resonance centres. We measure the number of atoms remaining after a collision, elucidating how the different loss processes are influenced by the tweezer depth. These measurements probe the energy released during an inelastic collision, and thus give information on the states of the collision products. We also identify resonances with atom pairs prepared in the absolute ground state \$(f=3, m\_f=3)\$, where two-body radiative loss is engineered by an excitation laser blue-detuned from the Cs D\$\_2\$ line. These results demonstrate optical tweezers to be a versatile tool to study two-body collisions with number-resolved detection sensitivity.},

  abstract = {We report the preparation of exactly one 87Rb atom and one 133Cs atom in the same optical tweezer as the essential first step towards the construction of a tweezer array of individually trapped 87Rb133Cs molecules. Through careful selection of the tweezer wavelengths, we show how to engineer species-selective trapping potentials suitable for high-fidelity preparation of Rb + Cs atom pairs. Using a wavelength of 814 nm to trap Rb and 938 nm to trap Cs, we achieve loading probabilities of 0.508(6) for Rb and 0.547(6) for Cs using standard red-detuned molasses cooling. Loading the traps sequentially yields exactly one Rb and one Cs atom in 28.4(6)\% of experimental runs. Using a combination of an acousto-optic deflector and a piezo-controlled mirror to control the relative position of the tweezers, we merge the two tweezers, retaining the atom pair with a probability of . We use this capability to study hyperfine-state-dependent collisions of Rb and Cs in the combined tweezer and compare the measured two-body loss rates with coupled-channel quantum scattering calculations.},

  abstract = {We report simultaneous Raman sideband cooling of a single \$\^\{87\}\$Rb atom and a single \$\^\{133\}\$Cs atom held in separate optical tweezers at 814\textbackslash,nm and 938\textbackslash,nm, respectively. Starting from outside the Lamb-Dicke regime, after 45\textbackslash,ms of cooling we measure probabilities to occupy the three-dimensional motional ground state of 0.86\$\^\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.04\}\$ for Rb and 0.95\$\^\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.04\}\$ for Cs. Our setup overlaps the Raman laser beams used to cool Rb and Cs, reducing hardware requirements by sharing equipment along the same beam path. The cooling protocol is scalable, and we demonstrate cooling of single Rb atoms in an array of four tweezers. After motional ground-state cooling, a 938\textbackslash,nm tweezer is translated to overlap with a 814\textbackslash,nm tweezer so that a single Rb and a single Cs atom can be transferred into a common 1064\textbackslash,nm trap. By minimising the heating during the merging and transfer, we prepare the atoms in the relative motional ground state with an efficiency of 0.81\$\^\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.08\}\$. This is a crucial step towards the formation of single RbCs molecules confined in optical tweezer arrays.},
