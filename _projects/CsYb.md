Research Goals
The Cs-Yb project is unique in combining two atomic species with very different properties. This leads to a rich experimental platform, with many potential research directions. Our immediate research goals focus on two themes:

1. The study of quantum degenerate atomic gas mixtures. Here we exploit the range of Yb isotopes, both bosonic and fermionic, together with the ability to tune the Cs-Cs interactions using a Feshbach resonance to probe a variety of phenomena, including beyond mean-field physics through the formation of heteronuclear quantum droplets.

2. The creation of ultracold CsYb molecules for quantum simulation. Such molecules have a doublet-sigma symmetry in the ground state, resulting in both a magnetic and an electric dipole moment. This leads to richer physics, particularly in optical lattices where CsYb molecules could be used to simulate quantum spin models.

Current Work
Our recent work has established the interspecies scattering lengths and precise predictions for the location of interspecies Feshbach resonances. We are currently measuring the interspecies Feshbach spectrum using fermionic 173Yb and are developing the hardware to spin-polarize the Yb gas. At the same time, we are installing a tunable optical trap operating around 460 nm. This trap will be used to enhance the overlap of the Cs-Yb gases and to also create species specific optical lattices. This capability will underpin our research on quantum droplets, as well as enhancing the prospects of magnetoassociation on an interspecies Feshbach resonance to form molecules.

Team
Our team consists of PI Simon Cornish, PDRAs Kali Wilson and Alex Guttridge, and PhD student Jack Segal. We also have several theory collaborators, including Simon Gardiner from the Department of Physics at Durham University, Jeremy Hutson and Matthew Frye from the Department of Chemistry at Durham University, and Tom Billam, Nick Parker, Nick Proukakis and I-Kang Liu from the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics at Newcastle University.
