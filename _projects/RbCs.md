Ultracold polar molecules offer a wide range of exciting research directions owing to their long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions and rich internal structure. Proposed applications span the fields of ultracold chemistry, precision measurement, quantum simulation and quantum computation.

In this experiment we produce ultracold RbCs molecules in the rovibrational and hyperfine ground state by associating ultracold Rb and Cs atoms using a two-step process. Starting from an atomic mixture with high phase-space density, we use magnetoassociation on a Feshbach resonance to produce weakly bound molecules. These molecules are then coherently transferred to a single deeply bound rovibrational state of the ground electronic state with near unity efficiency, using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). The final temperature mirrors that of the original atomic gas, allowing us to exploit the established techniques of atomic cooling to bring molecules into the ultracold regime.

## Coherent state control:

We have demonstrated the use of microwave fields to coherently transfer ~100% of the population between the lower lying rotational and hyperfine states. We are building on this to develop a "toolbox" of techniques for coherent state control.



Rabi oscillations between the two lowest rotationally excited states in RbCs. Each is driven as a single photon excitation.

## Molecular collisions:
The lifetime of heteronuclear molecules such as RbCs is expected to be on the order of many seconds due to the lack of reactive and inelastic collisions. However, significant loss is seen after hundreds of microseconds, and this is an unexpected problem across all observed species of alkali-alkali hetronuclear molecules. The loss mechanism may be due to the proposed theory of "sticky collisions". We are invistigating into the loss processes and conditions, and working towards controlling the losses.
